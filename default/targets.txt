# This file contains targets, that are defined in the scope. As preferred
# format use domains or IP addresses to use targets also in combination with
# other tools, protocols, URL paths, etc..
#
# Write concrete (network) services, discovered during testing period, in a
# separate file like "services.txt". This way the base is not mixed up with
# working data and the items in this file can be used flexible.
#
# To filter this file use the following command
#     egrep -v "^\s*(\#|$$)" targets.txt
#
# By using comments, items can be structured and documented in this file.

# Append domains or IP addresses here ...
